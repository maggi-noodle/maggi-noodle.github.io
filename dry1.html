At this point, we had spent so much time with each other in that bed that the whole room smelled of our flesh. Droplets of moisture condensed on the windows evaporating only in the small crack between the curtains where the sun shone through. Were it not for that
crack I would have no idea what time it was in the outside world, for here we ran on our own schedule, dividing moments into heartbeats and orgasmic spasms.<br><br>
I would estimate that it had been about a week since we had fallen into this hole, reading old Tantric texts out loud to each other on how to form harmonious union. Even as her eyelids grew heavy from the dictation, I kept going–– looking forward to the conclusion when we could actually unionize. I projected the pdf onto the wall and performed shadow puppetry as I read. I was living the text, contorting my body into the shape of a camel with its tail swung up when suddenly there was a blasted knock on the door. “I can get it,” I whispered lightly to her, grazing her sweet mounds.

The smell of cut grass was thick in the air as the collective buzz of machines congealed into a deep, enveloping drone. I stepped out to pick up the mail and waved to Mr. Bobertson who lived in the house next door. We attended the same yoga class on Wednesdays. Only one letter, from the theatre at 7 Eurasian Way. They wanted me again for their new season, this time for parody adaptation of The Passion of the Christ. I was cast for the role of “Sex(y) God”. I rolled my eyes and headed back indoors. Just then a firm, warm gust of blew up my bathrobe, revealing my lack of underwear. The drone of lawnmowers suddenly went silent.

    <th><li class='red'><a href=#><br>I groaned to be writing such trash. But I had to make a few bucks to feed the little spawn I was raising alone–– a consequence of a gorgeous but disastrous research summit. Inspired by one of our more eminent colleague’s talk on The New Erotica: Setting the Stage for a Post-Orgasmic Universe, we sauntered back to their deluxe suite to participate in one of the most productive inspiration orgies of all time. Unfortunately, instead of producing a boundary shattering piece of erotic non-fiction I was left with a fertilized ovary that blossomed into a lifetime of responsibility. <br><br>

And so, I had fallen down a rung in the hierarchy of love-researchers and found myself writing boring fuck stories for the barely literate masses who still enjoyed pornography in printed form. At $0.15 a word though, it was at least enough to sustain me and my “greatest literary achievement ever.” Plus, it was easy. After carefully writing the first few paragraphs and ensuring my readers’ critical faculties had been surpassed by more primitive considerations, I had free reign. If my characters fell apart, if I continually pulled the rug out from under them, it wasn’t a big deal so long as the words kept people wet, sweat, and tickled. <br><br>

Still, I had ambitions. I was an intellectual. And thus I continued to pursue my academic career. I felt like such a phony, cradling my baby as I theorized from a hypothetical space of radical sensuo-sexual liberation, but I had to press on, to construct a career for myself, to create the orgasmic universe I had momentarily glimpsed that one fateful eve. Recently, I had been researching a new emergent failure mode within technological advancements in romance known as ghosting. All my friends complained and were confused about this phenomenon, but I was able to approach it with an air of scientific indifference. To properly conduct my research, I forced myself to go on many dates, most of them bad. All of them came to the same outcome regardless of the bearability of the other party: one after another, we would gaze into each other’s eyes for a few seconds at a time. Our pupils might dilate in each others’ presence, and then after at most three weeks, I would cut off contact if they hadn’t done so already.<br><br>

Now, with this budding ability to create actual literal universes, the investigations I had thrown myself into with such abandon seemed so trivial that I could barely muster the mental cohesion to care. It was my overwhelming streak of completionism, the same one that earned me my PhD in retro-speculative post-vagino-eroticism, the same one that I knew would force me to raise this child into adulthood, that drove me to carry on my research. Until I had a definitive explanation of the mechanisms of Ghosting, or at the very least a publishable monograph on the topic, I would press on with these experiments.<br><br>

A melodious chime on my phone, a new match on SquashSmashSqueal. Time for the next case study. We always went to the same Chinese restaurant, Harmonious Union, and I always ordered the pineapple rice. This was both to ensure my experiments were conducted under the same conditions, to isolate the variables, and because this restaurant’s pineapple rice was the best in the entire west village.<br><br>

This man showed up in a beige overcoat and round glasses. His lips were scrunched as if he was perpetually smelling something foul. The bizarrely unique man somehow had an air of familiarity, though I couldn’t place where I had seen him. Moments after we sat down he got straight to business. “I am Edwin Schrödinger.” he declared, “After reading his magnum opus My View of the World, I knew I had actually written it myself.”<br><br>

“Wow, what’s it like being such an eminent mind? Your view of the world is so unique, your perceptive abilities so sharp! I wish I could be inside you to experience the universe through your unique outlook.”<br><br>

All these men were the same, the one who was “actually really Banksy”, the one who “pissed the entire Mekong river”, the one who “invented the avocado emoji”, the one who “knitted Steve Job’s turtleneck”, the one who “kept the three rulers of the entire world monetary system in a terrarium and sustained them on wiggling white weevils”. I stroked their embellished egos to see if their personal fictions could take on worthwhile narrative structure. They never did, but this time things were different.<br><br>

“I know it seems absurd, but recently I have been trying to defend my crowning literary achievement. As much as I respect the Hindu people for their invention of time travel, I cannot forgive the blatant plagiarism they committed when they republished my work as their Vedantas.” 
<br><br>
He declared this in his heavy Polish accent. I could not be sure if it was a riff or a serious, nor could I be sure if his accent was real because of the exaggerated way his mouth moved when he spoke. He always looked like he was chewing, regardless of what activity his strong mandibles were engaged in.<br><br>

“And you, what is your wraison d’estre?”<br><br>

I decided to steer clear from revealing my new goddesshood to shield his precious mortal ego.<br><br>

“I’m studying ghosting, a recent process by which even promising new relationships spontaneously fade.”<br><br>

“Ahh yes, I can perhaps provide some insight: As entropy in the universe increases, simplifications to social network graphs must be made to maintain computability of the system. Otherwise, there will be runaway exponential explosions and serious lag times will ensue. Low weighted connections, or edges, are thus pruned to keep complexity at bay. These are often associated with newly formed relationships.”
<br><br>
“So love is impossible in the modern world?”<br><br>

“In the current version, yes, but I suspect the divine programmer will quash this bug shortly.”<br><br>

Under most circumstances this sort of digital new age evangelism would have turned me off completely, but since I had recently ascended to godhood myself it made enough sense to be true, even if there was no way I could publish this sort of explanation.<br><br>

I decided to go home with him, maybe sex would yield some insights. I didn’t know what else to do anyways, and this was the experimental procedure after all. The act was merely symbolic, barely qualifying as sex, and he insisted keeping his overcoat and glasses on the whole time. When he finished, he reached immediately for his pipe which he puffed long and ponderously. I was about to fall asleep when we heard a knock on the door. <br><br>

“I’ll get it.”
<br><br>
I left the room, just me again. Was this situation really fit for a goddess? Maybe I should just forget about the ghosting and worry about the godding.<br><br>

The knock again.<br><br>

I walked through the kitchen and peeped through the hole. The same man with the round spectacles, beige overcoat and vaguely disgusted face. Wasn’t I in his house?  <br><br>

As I was reaching out to turn the knob, a wave of nausea passed over me.  It was an overwhelming feeling of deja vu, my mind reaching in on itself, pulling itself apart in an attempt to find the non existent memories.

The nausea and confusion was too much for me. I ejected. These humans sure had a lot tied up into their reproductive strategies. And maybe my method of solving the wave equation quantization problem by dampening social complexity explosion was a little too hacky to stick.
Zelrinne was click-clacking away frantically at the input center.<br><br>

“This is bad, really bad. The containment breach is global”<br><br>

Just then, a chiming at my visitor entrance.<br><br>

“No matter what, DON’T ANSWER IT”<br><br>

The vizz activated. Somehow a three dimensional human entity had managed to occupy the space. It had that same beige overcoat and round spectacles.<br><br>

“What — how is that here?”<br><br>

“There's a level mismatch, if we aren’t extremely careful we will broil our physics into our own un-existence”<br><br>

Information density in my universe seemed to all be converging into a single subzone, by the local addressing system: 7 Eurasian 94666, an abandoned theatre with three stories, each with its own rotting red curtains. Somehow, every single door was opening to this address.<br><br>

Zelrinne removed the armsack from which she usually procured her ticklefizz and bubblebrains when we were not in crisis mode, that until recently had seemed permanently attached to her. She stretched it into a long monoluminescent cloak with an antiquated-looking bifocal vizz-apparatus. <br><br>

“This might be the most important thing we ever do.”<br><br>

She fitted them on me very carefully, but they felt very uncomfortable. I felt my body contorting, changing its nature. It was an unpleasant and disorienting feeling.<br><br>

“I’m sorry I have to do this to you, but it is absolutely necessary”<br><br>

She pinged in a sequence and moved it into the runtime queue. I began to understand the gravity of my fate as my entire experience shifted from being myself to being some creation by some entity that I had been all along. I found myself somewhere wet, dark and warm. I was no longer a god, that was for certain, but what was I?  A fresh human, somehow rendered retroactively at version 1.0 of the universe, banished for life to a lower realm.<br><br>
