        "Feminism is not simply a struggle to end male chauvinism or a movement to ensure that women will have equal rights with men; it is a commitment to eradicating the ideology of domination that permeates Western culture on various levels—sex, race, and class to name a few—and a commitment to reorganizing U.S. society so that the self-development of people can take precedence over imperialism, economic expansion, and material desires.” -bell hooks</head>

             The invention of Cyberfeminism dates back to 1992. Independently from each other, Sadie Plant (an English cultural theorist) and VNS Matrix (Australian artists' group) started to use the term. It resulted from the fusion of the words "Cyberspace" and "Feminism". Interestingly, the choice was for the prefix "cyber", and not for "techno" or "virtual" to indicate something new. "Cyber" derived from cybernetics as described by its founded Norbert Wiener, as an assumption that there is an analogy between organic and technologically regulated systems in transmitting and processing information. In the mid 80s the science-fiction author William Gibson termed "cyberspace", the spaceless, virtual world of electronic networks, an ethereal space of collective hallucination. In cyberspace the body has vanished, flesh only exists as wetware. This vision clearly indicates a holistic and maybe even a sexist fantasy, as women are mainly regarded as fembots and cyberbabes. In light of the sexist ideas inherent in the word cyber, the addition of the word feminism creates an ironical twist and offers space for alternative interpretations for what cyberspace could be.
Although VNS Matrix and Sadie Plant came up with the term in the same year, they use it in different ways. Plant associates Cyberfeminism with a relation between women and technology, which she describes as intimate and subversive. For her, Cyberfeminism is the "theoretical answer to the fact that more and more women give their innovative input into electronic art and virtual technologies." In her latest book "Zeros and Ones" she fully expounds this theoretical answer. Her basic assumption is that a female signification comes along with the digitalization of society. To argue her theory she takes up different threads and weaves them together into a model of a new society. The spread of non-linear, decentralized and unhierarchical structures plays the central part. Plant recognizes them as the return of the "female principle". This process does not result from political or other intervention, but happens automatically, without any effort. Making this assertion transfers power and creativity to the new technologies, their inherent characteristics and the constellation they arise from.(SOFT POWER) 78
Plant sketches a utopian model, and claims it as reality. The female and the digital society are her inspiration, and she brings them together in a way from which neither can escape anymore. What was meant to be a positive utopia causes a feeling of uneasiness by its immanent hopelessness. For her argument, Plant co-opts Irigaray's ideas of female symbolisation; traditional ways of historiography (producing heroes/heroines and figures of identification like Ada Lovelace); Freud's concept of weaving women symbolizing their penis envy; and the universality of the Turing machine that is compared to female mimicry. Apparantly she didn't leave any questions unanswered. Here I'd like to propose another experiment, which is to read Plant as if she were making an ironical assertion. That gives back subversive power to her rigid concept. Unfortunately, it is not meant that way. The approach of the artistic ancestresses of Cyberfeminism, VNS Matrix, is quite different. Although they share Plant's sense that digital society is a feminization, their poetic emissions from and about the female body are always accompanied by a wink and a nudge. Moreover, their more literal efforts to contaminate technology with blood, slime, cunts [sic] and madness were anarchic enough to profane the prevalent myth that "technology" is just "toys for boys." 
<ul> Responsibility for organizing the CI workdays was taken on by Old Boys Network(OBN)–an ad hoc group of about six women–in on-line consultation with all participants. Because of the on-line communications between the OBN leadership and participants, collaborative working relationships and the content of the meetings were already established by the time the participants met together face to face in Kassel. A shifting and diverse group of more than thirty women (self-selected by open invitation to members of the FACES listserv, [with a core of about ten]) participated in the CI.</ul>

<ul> 'The Annals of Private History' is a piece on introspection. The central thread is the history of diaries (and women's relationships with them), which will talk about parallel histories and the things that are lost due to repressive structures and a lack of appropriate platforms/safe spaces where to share one’s thoughts.
The main narrative - the fictionalised History of the Diary, will expand on why little girls are given diaries when they are little, paying attention to repressive details like the padlock and the bedroom.
This focus on the diary not only feeds directly from Ulman's wider practice, which interrogates gender roles, but also acts as a metaphor or symbol for structure of repression, or the feeling of not being able to speak. What is allowed live, to be public, within society, and what must remain hidden and private?
Ulman’s resume looks like this:

<ul class="red-hi"> The Internet presence of Liz Mputu, affably represented by Bete Noire 3 on Soundcloud, also assumes an experience of healing with an addendum of indulgent interiority and radical black femme transparency. Often, Liz’s commentary of technoculture is both figuratively and literally wrapped around her body in the images they display. Liz’s sound art, a loving and honest affirmation of what it means to be human, complicated, and beautiful in those complications is an arrangement of poetry, reflections, self-produced music, fast-cadenced witty rap, and warped samples. Liz’s commentary memento PRESSED BUT COPING CREATIVELY accents background television sounds of the news, a quiet narration feature that one could allude to what scholar and artist Kodwo Eshun calls “futures industry” or “forecasts,” a dystopic commentary of economic distress, global warfare, and other catastrophic events often dejecting the livelihoods of POC. Liz’s Soundcloud also envelops “Whoswatching,” a track that underscores Rockwell’s “Somebody’s Watching Me” alongside eerie cinematic sound motifs; the spoken word piece “things I wanted 2 text redeem but worked over perfectly in my head instead as preparation 2 being Ur man Or something:” which complicates the spectrums of black pride and queer veiling (“I wonder the line between pro-black wokeness and I’m gonna exorcise the faggot out/Is there room for us my love?”); and “CyberSerenity X So Much More [Healz 4 U],” a cosmic and android-voiced mantra of spiritual alleviation.

<h1>critique</h1>  the impact of postcolonial studies on electronic media practice, theory, and criticism has been negligible; In cyberfeminism, the difference most celebrated and discussed (apart from sexual orientation) is the often-narcissistic construction of the self as Other by adopting the cyborg and the monster as figures of liberation and self-represen- tation. To be sure, the transformation to “cyborgs” of bodies previously cast as “unfit” has been uplifting and enabling for numerous individuals. Yet, a cyborg identity is primarily claimed by those categorized as the norm in previous colo- nial and eugenic taxonomies: If you are white, educated and affluent, the cyborg is your ticket to difference.6 

Pan-capitalism has blurred the distinctions between developed/underdevel- oped, first world/third world as these conditions coexist in almost all geo- graphical locations. a crucial question to be posed by cyberfeminists is whether non-specificity of purpose and politics are viable strategies for survival, resistance, and for a more just distribution of resources and power which is one of the central goals of feminism. As women from developing countries increasingly become the home-service and child-care labor employed by wealthier families—as well as the world’s electronic parts manufacturers, assemblers, and data maintenance workers—the lives of white women and women of color are mutually reliant. This interdependence stresses the rele- vance of postcolonial studies for critical cyberfeminisms.

        The motto of the 2013 International Symposium of Electronic Art (ISEA) in Syndey reflected this zeitgeist provocatively, appropriating language from Star Trek's Borg population: "Resistance is futile." The political narrative fed into our brains on a daily basis is that there are no alternatives. What does that mean for critical art and cultural production? 
   
Create your own Cyberfeminism, any you find out the truth about it. 
Now, this question brings me to another question, which may seem divergent but will circle around to our fundamental function: is
