         <th><li class='red'><a href=#><br>     I‚Äôm a pretty cool pple. I Smol, nd I dont get out much on account of thes fkin mountains. Up till a few decade ago, I didn‚Äôt read or rite, tried it once, but I either decided it wuz lame or ate da tasty oxhide papes or something who gives a fuck. I just tell thes stories to the children, and sometimes they even remember.¬† I got a chill thing goin on here tho, spend my days lookin at different plants and animals, burnin hella trees, its dope af.¬†<br><br>
One day this guy named Chinny shows up at my door and tells me I‚Äôve been living in his garden this whol time. Now to me, this whol encounter is weird because u c, wher I‚Äôm from everyon is named Akkuh. But watevr my weirdly named pengyou, shoot yr shot. Pengyou says dat since I‚Äôm living in like, literally (lol wat do i even kno about literal) the most inconvenient place on da whole of earf and since he cant build low quality high density multiplexes ther he wont fuk wit me 2 much. Jus let my nerdy frens come visit n we chill.¬†<br><br>

Aight watever. N so next thing i kno thers a bunch of geeks here trying 2 perservert our cultur. Dese silly lil derpnuts aight, but all dey does is write all day. Maybe I would know y writing was so lame if I made a note of it, but I would hella rather just not be lame than b lame nd kno y. Nyways dese fools wrote som real books fulled with paper and words nd den dey went over to some hella far place called Japan wher pple wanted 2 phase 2 of perservert da cultur bcus they thought we wer brothors. I like met¬†these fools once, liek i don kno u. Dey got help from ther friend Ford becuz he hated poor pepple, nd they said that they wud use the money 2 make us less poor.<br><br>Dey used da monies to make me ego-museums that tiptoed lightly in the carbon, but I‚Äôm just not about that life. I wanna b outside nd burning trees wit da seasons, so when Ford left to go mess shit up for some other poors da spaces kinda dwindled nd nobody goes dere no more. O, I didn‚Äôt mention the rubber trees dey brought, yep, that took a lot of land nd native crops. Now tha kids heading out in the wee hours of darkness to collect tha liquid to convert to rmbs. <br><br>
Dese days I‚Äôm conflicted. Sometimes I‚Äôm super psyched that dese mountains keep most of the weirdos out and let me do my thing, but sometimes I wish Chinny would come by more often, I mean I know he‚Äôs been mean 2 the other pples in his garden (and sometimes maybe a little mean to me), but it gets lonely out here and life in the mountains can b hard. Maybe ill venture out, everyone out there spennin hours dancing on a giant spider web. Sounds dope, but also spooky. Meanwhile da eggheads still rolling thru, bein all like ‚Äúcurrent scholarship takes a more nuanced approach to accommodating the Yunan pple into the current socioethnoconopolitic fabric while simultaneously respecting both the desires of the people and the impending obsolescence of their solely individual embodiments‚Äù I‚Äôm like lol tru dat; but I knew dat 2000 yrs ago nd represented it using this pictogram üåø<br></a></li></th>
