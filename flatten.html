    <th><li class='blu'>Here’s a version of the parable of Yu Gong. They told the Old Man: the mountain, with its head as white as his, will not move, but he feigns deafness. They mock him, shaking their fans and leaning forward so he can better see their sneers, but the Old Man wags his head and flashes a toothy grin. The townsfolk gossip behind his back and marvel at the futility of his endeavor. The Old Man, persistent or foolish, just dreams of waking up to see the mountain gone.</li></th>
    <th><li class='red'> In 2012, the city of Lanzhou plans to flatten 700 mountains on its outskirts. Slice the tops off the mountains, fill in the valleys, and presto: nice, flat space. The new plains will be en route to the airport. Sweltering sun en route to the desert bakes the soil. </li>
<br><br><li class='green'>
In Chinese, hill and mountain are the same word: 山. If it’s any consolation, the mountains in Lanzhou might more readily be classified as hills. Semantics aside, it is neither cheap nor easy. Costing about 20 million yuan, work was halted in April 2013, after visible air pollution led to calls for an environmental assessment. While work began again four weeks later due to financial pressure from the local government and contractors, the environmental assessment has yet to be completed. “There has been too little modeling of the costs and benefits of land creation.” “Inexperience and technical problems delay projects and add costs, and the environmental impacts are not being thoroughly considered.” In cities such as Chongqing, Shiyan, Yichang, and now Lanzhou, tens of square kilometres of flatlands have now been created from hills.

      Chinese scientists call to accelerate research on land creation. At least this time there are bulldozers. However, the dust still alights and dismal air quality forces a pause for environmental assessment. A flattening project at Yan’an is the largest ever attempted on “loess”, which is thick, million-year-old deposits of wind-blown silt. Soft soils like this can subside when wet, causing structural collapse.<br><br></li></th>

Back to rice farming. I’ve gained 10 kilos since starting. Self-consciously dramatic, I kick rocks down the mountain, watching them dislodge and crash into the dust. In a land of kaleidoscopic danger, what is one more if a rock goes free?

First time I heard Liu Sola’s voice on the song "一天过去了（The Day is Over)", I could relate to her wails. Her voice is also featured in Moving the Mountain (1994), a documentary about the Tiananmen Massacre available, it seems, on Youtube.
<br><br>
The film opens with a Chinese-Canadian man revisiting his Toishan village. I am decidedly confused, as the film shows nothing relating to 0604. Scrolling to the comments, I read the only comment. It gives the helpful hint: an embedded link to another youtube titled MTM6.VOB
<br><br>
Some funny scavenger hunt I have joined. Swearing I just want to listen to more of Liu Sola’s discography, I open the link which takes me to part 6 of 8 of the actual documentary. Each upload is around 15 minutes. I do like the media-consuming technique of starting in the middle, going to the end, and if worth it, rerouting to the beginning.

One of the Chinese democracy boys says, “Freedom is just like oxygen. You wouldn’t feel it when you have it.” 
At the Golden Gate bridge, another says, “My mind goes to the end of the water— China.” Imposed amnesia must have its reasons, and my own grasp of history is colored by the imposed amnesia I have gone through. Forgetting that when the USSR fell in 1992, many Chinese were actually jealous, thinking the Soviet people’s lives would improve with the new “freedom”, conveniently forgetting how

Airy flutes and heavy drums flavor the movie. I watch a bit of the beginning, but find not much surprising in what it reveals and doesn’t. If what makes art aesthetic is repression of desire, then collective amnesia is the most natural form of art.

I walked into the office of Li Siguang, whom I knew only by reputation—— an isotope geologist whose exacting contributions to geochronology could have not repressed his interest in talking to randos like me.

Walking along the New Lanzhou Area he expressed his interest in crustal settings, global tectonics, the Big Picture. What is eternity? What is love? What is art?<br>
