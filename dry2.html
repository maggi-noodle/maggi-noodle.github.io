    <th><li class='blu'><br>It took me some time to get used to the controls, to assimilate to the rhythm of what life was in this universe. Here, time was measured in years, a unit defined by the celestial mechanics I had once developed, but was now inscribed in. After a few of these had passed, I was used to my new, complicated existence, the inefficiently designed sensory inputs, the necessity of eating, and most incomprehensibly of all, the hairs. There were just so many of them and they seemed to serve absolutely no purpose. After an awkward in-between period, the cloak became that beige overcoat and round spectacles which had a habit of reoccurring. I knew I could not remove them, as doing so would certainly rupture the delicate neural connections that supported my existence in this primitive universe. 		<br><br>

Once I had accustomed myself to human existence, I began to focus on understanding the bug that had once plagued me as a programmer and now plagued me as a subroutine of the program. It was indeed a complicated knot in the code, rendered more difficult to untie by my absurd lack of administrator privileges. Still, I knew, or at least I hoped, that Zelrinne was up above watching me and could implement the changes I came up with. This was confirmed during the first rainstorm when I walked out and every single raindrop avoided me precisely.<br><br>

And so, with nothing else to do but breathe air and study physics I figured out how to quantize my waves using some clever but computationally efficient linear algebra. And since I was writing the physics, I might as well take credit for discovering it. I became known as a groundbreaking physicist and slowly accumulated more administrator privileges in the form of assistants and collaborators. Finally, after about 15 years of tinkering, I lived in a beautiful, bugless universe, with processing power to spare, which I used to develop ornate fish and insects. I created a nice documentation for it all, and then since there was nothing godly left to do, I began to explore what earthly pleasures existed in my own little world. I left the oppressive but regimented country in which I had done most of my work for a freer one where I started a cozy little 3-pod with two sweet and kind wives. The other humans looked down on us for they did not mate in this pattern, but how was I supposed to know this? It was good for awhile, and then they died, and I continued on my way. Would I continue to exist like this indefinitely? <br><br>

I wandered aimlessly, floated and bobbed, soaking in the beautiful 1.57 E+33 Plank length per inch universe in full resolution. I was so proud of my work. If only I could get back home I would most certainly get a grant for a top-of-the-line research level simulator. And yet here I was, stuck in my own simulation. And so I took photographs and made films, sampled the wide variety of psychoactive compounds that were available and learned to make time flexible as the Hindus did using the forward-looking caterpillar and rearward-looking butterfly. As I made my way through the various spiritual traditions people here practiced I began to wonder if every universe, or at least every stable one had some fallen angel, someone on the ground to make sure everything ran smoothly. And if so, did they all want to go back as badly as I did?<br><br>

As my cursory sampling of earth continued, I developed a method to interview other humans and see if my creation was satisfied and if I was satisfied in my creation, but mostly for entertainment. The app, SmashSquashSqueal, was an instant success, and it provided decades of fun. Each of these humans was a unique distillation of an arbitrary past, unlike my old people who had all undergone the same optimal maturation routine. While I suffered from a deep and cosmic ennui, at least I might never get bored.<br><br>

One evening I found myself in a hole in the wall Chinese restaurant in the west village with a youngish woman of fading intellectuality. She seemed relatively unremarkable, a typical human at that phase in their life where they begin to feel the banality of existence closing in on them. But one thing was different: unlike the other humans I had connected to I was unable to command the same sort of attention from her that I was used to. Most humans could intuitively sense my godliness, why did she not care? The scent of her steamed pineapple rice wafted into my nostrils, familiar to me though I had never smelled it before. I did my best to hold her attention, revealing as much about my true identity as I could while still being believable. Only when we got up did I remember the evening with the strange man in the brown overcoat who was now me. Maybe this time it could be different. It was storming heavily so we took a taxicab to my place. She insisted on having sex even after I revealed that I was a never-nude. The obsession with abstracted reproductive acts no longer confused me, but I was still disgusted by it. I did the minimum and reached for my pipe. Just then, a knock at the door. Something in my body changed, I was finally ready to transcend, to break free from the shell that both protected and imprisoned me.<br><br>

“I’ll get it”<br><br>

I grabbed her by the arm.<br><br>

“Don’t!”<br><br>

I took off my overcoat and spectacles and she stood next to the bed shocked, staring at the luminescing raw ports on my body, which tingled and spasmed, feeling the air for the first time.<br><br> 

“I’m sorry I have to do this to you, but the fate of the universe depends on it”<br><br>

I draped the overcoat over her shoulders and put the spectacles on her face. I folded her up in the jacket, which became thinner and paperier with each fold, in the end giving a beautifully bound folio book.<br><br>

The knock at the door continued. It was my turn to open it.
