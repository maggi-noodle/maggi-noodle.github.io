    <th><li class='blu'><a href=#><br>It had been raining for awhile. The raindrops clicked in the puddles and wet cement. God’s million little fingers hard at work editing. When the work was done and the sun returned we would venture out to see what changes had been made, but for now we stayed inside where it was warm and safe.
We turned the heat all the way up and snuggled under the covers. The warmth and humidity created a tropical microclimate. Our own world, we were the gods here.
    <br><br>
A ring at the doorbell. A pause. We looked at each other. Who would be the one to leave the bed to answer it? It was my turn this time. I left the bed and my sweat began to cool immediately, leaving me shivering.<br><br>
There was a dry mister in a beige overcoat. A mysteriously dry mister.<br><br>
I clicked the “call” button, “Excuse me, what do you want?”<br><br>
He didn’t answer, just continued to stand there. I could hear my own digitized voice echoing back outside, his avoidance was deliberate. He looked straight into the cctv camera, staring at me with an expectant gaze through his round spectacles. He had no way of seeing me, but I could still feel his gaze.
I was afraid to go outside, but at the same time I felt compelled to. Ever since I had opened the video feed, he had not blinked a single time. I tried to speak again, to ask another question, but words could not leave my mouth.<br><br>
Resigned, I put on my robe and slippers. My co-diety murmured, half asleep, “Who is it?” “I don’t know, I have to go down I guess.”
I braced myself for the biting cold that awaited me with the mister on the other side of that door. I clenched the pores of my skin into tight goosebumps and gnashed my teeth, releasing calcium grits into my dry mouth. I reached for the door.<br><br></a></li></th>

The man was gone, the sun was out, the doorstep was dry. On the welcome mat a business card: At every level, a calamity. At every stage, a miracle. I picked it up–– an address on the other side, 7 Eurasian 94666.<br><br>
Warm wind blew up my silky robes. The neighbor, out mowing his lawn, gave me a friendly wave. I lightly closed the door and a gust slammed it loudly shut.
I went back upstairs, back under the covers with my heater still cranked up to the max. Alone and warm with the book I had been reading: Playing God: The Illustrated Guide to Universe Instantiation, Chapter 6 1/2: What happens to reality when the substrate over which it is instantiated is removed?<br><br>
I could swear I had had someone waiting for me in bed. A co-diety, a lover, there was this whole history we had together. A romantic dinner gone awry, a traffic jam turned into a karaoke contest, an inside joke about soaps. Clearly it was all false. There was no one in the bed. I must have constructed an entire narrative while checking the door.<br><br>
Since I had started reading this book my mind seemed to have developed a life of its own. It had been running out of control, overpowering every other aspect of my being. While the ability to create reality was appealing, I might not have pursued it had I realized it might damage the cohesion of my own.<br></a></li></th>

“Get the physics engine set up right and the rest just falls out.” Too bad the physics is always the finickiest part with its self organization at large sales, and pseudo-randomness at smaller ones. This time it was a dense matter accumulation in the N7 sector causing an integer overflow. The entire region filled with zeroes. Looks like another night of debugging... Not that there was much else to do on a murkily pescillant evening like this one. I put on the rain to keep any nosy humans out of the workspace. No need to create any new religions for universe v2893.0.3. And to think that silly human Leibniz thought I got it right with version 1.0...<br><br>
Unzeroeing the space was easy enough, but it took a few thousand replays before I was able to spot where my sparsity enforcement failed. The crashing and snapping outside redoubled and I was thankful that I had ended up staying in. In any case, the error was much more subtle than I had anticipated, it could have taken me all night to rectify. It was a particularly rare set of coincidences that allowed the accumulation to happen, but it would certainly occur again if the exception handler was left unchanged. I was in the middle of listing the required conditionals when a large pescetic entity broke, oversaturating my energy regulator. To avoid frying the banks, computation was halted midーcompilation.<br><br>
I re-clicked the system and generated a report. It was an absolute mess. Causality flaws, continuity errors, plot holes... people would be questioning their sanity for quite awhile after this one. Most alarming however, was a containment breach. It seemed that my documentation had leaked into the program under the form of an instruction manual for the creation of universes. I had to act immediately. My hobbyist- class universe rendermachine could not handle any sub-instantiations, let alone the runaway recursions that would likely happen if one of my dumb humans tried to play god. The whole system would broil.<br><br>
I was able to delete all but one instance of the manual. For this last instance, a human had taken advantage of a plothole to read all the way up to the 6 1/2th chapter, acquiring Godwill that I could not simply contradict. I would have to convince them to give up universe-craft voluntarily. Or maybe I would end up convincing myself.<br><br>
In these cases I had a few tools at my disposal: Love, Piety, Destiny, Pride: the soft powers of the gods for when floods, earthquakes and fires would not do. To finagle this sort of maneuver requires very delicate manipulation and thorough understanding of my target. Sure, I have access to the exact positions of every atom of every molecule of every synapse of the human in question, but to sort the tangled and haphazardly evolved mess of seemingly unrelated tidbits into a cohesive psychological understanding was above my processing level. Especially if I wanted to play with its emotions enough to convince it to give up something as alluring as godhood. I needed to call on an outside power.<br><br>
I bimmed Zelrinne, that rich and kooky melon-ship captain who always had some gigas to spare so long as I could sit through her absurd conspiracy theories about supremum universes and how there was some kind of automated creator spirit that wove intangible memories through a hierarchy of simulations. According to her fallacious “as above so below” reasoning, our plane sat at some point in an infinite stack
of others, like a single flapjack in an infinite heap of pancakes, with syrup messily running down. Zelrinne rezzed up to the vizzy.
The gods sure are angry tonight! She greeted. I’ve had 9 pescetic ruptures in the local octant alone and getting reports of worse elsewhere! How hard are you hit?<br><br>
Pretty bad, I had a neighborhood rupture instantiate mid-compilation. Emergency shutdown procedures resulted in a containment breach with a high risk of runaway recursion.<br><br>
I’ll be right over.<br><br>
I liked Zelrinne. For all of her kookiness, there was also an intensity and tenderness in her presence. She was a gentle soul, willing to save my ass even if I was just a hobbyist-class universe simulator amidst a region saturated with enterprise and research-class equipment. For her, a universe was a universe was a universe. Even if it was just the pipe dream of a stoned frog drying over the dregs of Driscle Bay.
Within a few epicycles she arrived with render tube in hand, the spiral tips of her long tresque frizzling effervescently with leftover statics from the terrible storm that continued to rage outside the climate pod.<br><br>
Alright, lets save the world!<br><br>
I handed her the pointer to my human which she clicked into the tube’s beaconspace. We positioned our thodes and trodes, and said a quick prayer (whoever is listening, please will you do something about Entropy?) as we waited to load. 15%, 76%, 93%, 98%, 100%. Time to get our hands dirty.<br><br>
I braced myself for the dysphoric rush of entering a foreign qualia and losing all agency in my interactions. A passenger in a alien train, only I was the train. I’d done it a few times but never under this sort of duress. As I began to let my senses in I felt the absurd hairyness of the being I was inhabiting, the ability to sense something in the air that I called saltiness. I associated this “saltiness” with objects that my primitive system converted into energy through a painful and intrusive process. Most of my perceptive space however was dedicated to “sight”, a sense based on the bouncing wiggles of my simulation, currently focused intently on neatly organized rows of emergent squiggles which seemed to encode some kind of information that the humans created with intent.<br><br>
Forget the human experience, commed-in Zelrinne, you need to go deeper!<br><br>
I abstracted away the senses and did my best to experience this human on their own terms, as they would.<br><br>
