Volume 20, Issue 3, 2014, 179.">2</a>]</sup> </p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve been searching, and in my search, I find my robot within and in the gaps between the deep legacy of feminist science and technology theorizing, philosophical engagements on the human and posthuman, discourses and algorithms in robotics, racial theory, histories of the labor movement, and the feminist cyborg. This work includes delving into cuts, and soldering across the various parts. In this essay, I trace the theoretical genealogy of the representational processes of making and unmaking human and machine demarcations within the context of the US empire. In particular, I focus on race and how the Asian American is racialized as machine, and the robot in particular as a primary locus of racialization for Asian Americans. <em>But where to find her?</em> I follow feminist STS scholar Karen Barad’s formative essay on diffraction—the optical term for the slight bending of light around an object—as a reading and writing practice. As Barad outlines—drawing from Trinh Minh-ha, Donna Haraway, and Gloria Anzaldúa—diffraction is utilized as a metaphor and as performative writing at the edge and across the borderlands, while “re-returning” to feminist intellectual debts.<sup>[<a href="#footnote_2_2630" id="identifier_2_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Barad, 2014.">3</a>]</sup> Similarly, I trace the limits and possibilities of various discourses, and illustrate how the gaps make room to solder parts together-then-apart. I conclude by considering the cover image of Donna Haraway’s <em>Simians, Cyborgs, and Women</em>, by painter Lynn Randolph, as a visual example of the Asian American and/as automaton and her feminist possibilities. </p>
<p><strong>Human/Animal/Machine</strong></p>
<p>The human/animal distinction has been central to Euro-American modernity’s conceptualization of race. A third term, less analyzed within racial theory, has also played a central role: the machine. As a mechanism, race is inherently imbricated in the shifting demarcations between human, animal, and machine. Race has been utilized, as fiction and technique, to maintain differences and to justify denigration and subjugation as Western demarcations of the human in fact oscillate between the machine and the animal, both discursively and materially. In his reading of Derrida, posthumanist theorist Cary Wolfe argues that we must consider not only “the relationship of the human and animal, but also between the organism and the mechanical or technological.”<sup>[<a href="#footnote_3_2630" id="identifier_3_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Cary Wolfe, What Is Posthumanism? (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota, 2010).">4</a>]</sup> In demarcating the boundaries of the human, the machine—like the animal—prompts a comparative racial analysis. While the animal functioned as a mechanism for justifying slavery and objecthood for indigenous and Black people, the machine has largely been utilized in the service of Asian racialization and subjugation. </p>
<p><strong><em>Finding</em>: “Immigrants from the Future”</strong></p>
<p>In March 2014, a special issue of <em>The Economist</em>, ”Rise of the Robots,” published a report on robots entitled “Immigrants from the Future.”<sup>[<a href="#footnote_4_2630" id="identifier_4_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="&ldquo;Immigrants from the Future,&rdquo; The Economist, March 29, 2014.">5</a>]</sup> The report itself was nothing new; special issues on robots have been published before. For example, <em>Time</em> magazine released a special issue in 2013 that was identically entitled “Rise of the Robots”; both publications illuminate the ever-growing fascination with and trepidation about the role of artificial beings in society. Yet the title of <em>The Economist</em>’s special report is particularly interesting. While race is not mentioned, the trope of the robot and immigration is evoked through mention of the Russian-born American science fiction writer Isaac Asimov: “His robot stories, and those of his successors, were immigrant stories. Except that the robots are immigrants not from abroad but from the future.”<sup>[<a href="#footnote_5_2630" id="identifier_5_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Ibid., 4.">6</a>]</sup> As described by <em>The Economist</em>, Asimov’s stories were “immigrant” stories that explored issues of difference. While immigrants were not central characters in Asimov’s work, robots were, and they were largely featured as second-class laborers bearing an uncanny resemblance to the characterization of Asian Americans. As Jasia Reichardt writes in <em>Robots: Fact, Fiction, and Prediction</em>: “Indeed, in literature the robot has become a metaphor for a second-class citizen. Because the robot is made from metal, because it has been manufactured rather than grown, because it thinks with transistors rather than with protoplasm, it is almost always treated with condescension, even though it may demonstrate superhuman abilities, loyalty and talents.”<sup>[<a href="#footnote_6_2630" id="identifier_6_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Quoted in Ibid., 7.">7</a>]</sup> </p>
<p>Like Asian Americans, robots have been characterized as immigrants, “second-class citizens,” laborers, and Reichardt’s characterization of robots as having a second-class status bears an uncanny resemblance to the model minority stereotype of Asian Americans. Since the antebellum period in the early 1800s, Asian Americans however have been racialized as robots in popular visual culture and discourses due to their “labor.”<sup>[<a href="#footnote_7_2630" id="identifier_7_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Stephen Sohn, &ldquo;Introduction: Alien/Asian: Imagining the Racialized Future,&rdquo; The Society for the Study of the Multi-Ethnic Literature of the United States 33, no. 4 (2008): 6. ">8</a>]</sup> This characterization of Asian American as robots is entangled with the discourse of techno-Orientalism, a concept that Greta Niu describes as the “practice of ascribing, erasing, and/or disavowing relationships between technology and Asian peoples and subjects.”<sup>[<a href="#footnote_8_2630" id="identifier_8_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Greta Niu, &ldquo;Techno-Orientalism, Nanotechnology, Posthumans, and Post-Posthumans in Neal Stephenson&rsquo;s and Linda Nagata&rsquo;s Science Fiction,&rdquo; The Society for the Study of the Multi- Ethnic Literature of the United States 33, no. 4 (2008): 74. ">9</a>]</sup> Moreover, <em>The Economist</em>’s report reflects how both robots and Asian Americans have oftentimes been characterized as being from the future. Asian American racialization is distinctive because of its imbrication with the machine: specifically, the robot. Could we think about how the automaton, or robot, is much more than merely one of a “series” of characterizations of the Asian threat, but rather, as <em>The Economist</em> attests, a key locus of Asian American racialization?</p>
<p><strong>Asian as Machine-Like?</strong> </p>
<p>In her essay “Race and/as Technology; or, How to Do Things to Race,” new media theorist Wendy Hui Kyong Chun highlights how the human is created at the expense of the “machine-like” Asian/Asian American: “The human is constantly created through the jettisoning of the Asian/Asian American other as robotic, as machine-like and not quite human, as not quite lived. And also I would add, the African American other as primitive, as too human.”<sup>[<a href="#footnote_9_2630" id="identifier_9_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Wendy Chun. &ldquo;Race and/as Technology or How To Do Things To Race.&rdquo; In Race After the Internet. Edited by Lisa Nakamura and Peter A. Chow-White. (New York: Routledge, 2011), 51.">10</a>]</sup> Whites are positioned as “human,” while Asians/Asian Americans are racialized as “robotic,” and African Americans as “too human.” Although she provides critical interventions, Chun’s characterization of Asian Americans as “robotic” and “machine-like” suggests the two qualities are similar. While the Asian robot may be a stereotype, trope, or controlling image, I hope to build upon Chun’s articulation and demonstrate how the racialization of Asians/Asian Americans as the robot is dialectically connected. This connection between the Asian American and the robot is co-constitutive within the U.S. imaginary, and tracing these the convergences reveals configurations of race and resistance.<sup>[<a href="#footnote_10_2630" id="identifier_10_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Building upon Chun&rsquo;s formative work, I have outlined elsewhere, in my study of Nam June Paik&rsquo;s robotic art, that Asian Americans have been historically racialized as robotic in nineteenth-century popular automaton discourse. Margaret Rhee, &ldquo;Racial Recalibration.&rdquo; Asian Diasporic Visual Cultures and the Americas 1.3 (2015).">11</a>]</sup> </p>
<p><strong>On Robots: Soldering Across</strong></p>
<p>If the robot is a central locus of racialization for Asian Americans, imbricated with immigration and labor, how do we further understand the role of robots and humans in Western society? Robots are not only contemporary figures of fascination, as the special reports in <em>Time</em> and <em>The Economist</em> may suggest; they have been a source of awe, intrigue, and trepidation for several centuries. Scholarly monographs and art books about robots are for the most part fairly recent, and include <em>Human Robots in Myth and Science</em> by John Cohen (1966) and the aforementioned <em>Robots</em> by Reichardt (1978). Both of these works explore the historical figure of the robot. While Reichardt’s <em>Robots</em> focuses mainly on their literary and cinematic representations, Cohen’s work is more psychological and scholarly, and is largely regarded as a key text in the history of the robot. Other prominent theorists include the Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori, whose writings about the “uncanny valley”—the phenomenon through which people’s feelings of rapport with machines increase as machines become more lifelike, then plateau when they become “too” lifelike—have been formative in US robotics, cultural theory, and science fiction.<sup>[<a href="#footnote_11_2630" id="identifier_11_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Masahiro Mori, &ldquo;The Uncanny Valley,&rdquo; trans. Karl F. MacDorman and Norri Kageki, Spectrum, June 12, 2012. Originally published in Japanese in Energy 7, no. 4 (1970): 33&ndash;35.">12</a>]</sup> </p>
<p>In <em>Sublime Dreams of Living Machines: The Automaton in the European Imagination</em>, historian Minsoo Kang offers the first comprehensive historical and theoretical study of the automaton that provides specific contexts for the robot’s role in society. Kang’s study examines intellectual and literary texts to explore how the European imagination has conceived of the self-propelled, life-imitating machine. Kang argues that the concept of the automaton has played a significant role in the world of ideas, with the artificial entity appearing in some of the most important intellectual works in European history.<sup>[<a href="#footnote_12_2630" id="identifier_12_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Minsoo Kang, Sublime Dreams of Living Machines: The Automaton in the European Imagination (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2010), 5.">13</a>]</sup> However, Kang writes, “Ultimately, the real importance of the automaton idea lies in the crucial role it has played as a conceptual tool with which Western culture has pondered the very nature and boundaries of humanity.”<sup>[<a href="#footnote_13_2630" id="identifier_13_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Ibid., 12.">14</a>]</sup> As a conceptual tool, the automaton troubles the boundaries of the human and the machine and has also been utilized to uphold them.</p>
<p>Today, the robot serves as a cultural juxtaposition with the human. As Kang points out, “referring to someone as a machine can be an expression of admiration, for the demonstration of great productivity at a task, unerring accuracy, and grace in its execution.”<sup>[<a href="#footnote_14_2630" id="identifier_14_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Ibid., 3.">15</a>]</sup> Yet he also notes that “when a person is called an ‘automaton’ or a ‘robot’ it is usually a derogatory comment, denoting someone who is stiff and awkward in speech or movement; one who lacks imagination, emotion, spontaneity, or a sense of humor; a fanatical follower of rules…”<sup>[<a href="#footnote_15_2630" id="identifier_15_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Ibid., 4.">16</a>]</sup> Similarly, <em>The Economist</em>’s title “Immigrants from the Future” speaks to the ways Asian Americans have been racialized in similar tropes, as humans with “great productivity” yet missing something by virtue of lacking “creativity” and “emotions.” The cultural intersections of the Asian American and the robot shed light on the concept of belonging in our national imaginary, insofar as the robot and the Asian American has been utilized as a trope for the “second-class citizen.” </p>
<p>The human/machine/animal analytic is a formulation that has been widely theorized within Western philosophy, from Descartes and Rousseau into Derrida’s theorizations of the demarcations of difference. Cartesian philosophy is largely known and critiqued for its split between the mind and the body, but Descartes’s dualism can also be understood through his analysis of automata and the ways he believed human cognition to differ from the workings of machines. As contemporary historian David Bates argues, “Descartes… was interested in mapping systematically the unusual machinery of the body”; “the human body was a robotic information machine that was capable of interrupting itself.”<sup>[<a href="#footnote_16_2630" id="identifier_16_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="David Bates, &ldquo;Cartesian Robotics,&rdquo; Representations 124, no. 1 (2013): 43&ndash;68.">17</a>]</sup> Bates provides an important tracing of the Cartesian blurring of the boundaries between human and machine; however, he and other contemporary scholars who build upon Cartesian philosophy may inadvertently also elide how racialization, gender, and other differences of identity shape and reshape the demarcations of the human.</p>
<p>In this section, I demonstrate the gaps, the inadvertent, inadequate grappling with racialization, and the critique of the liberal human subject in contemporary philosophical engagements with the boundaries between human, animal, and machine. The liberal human subject emerges from Cartesian theorization and relies on the idea of a stable human and self. The lack of critical engagement with the liberal human subject often underlies the absence of a racial critique, although the two are not mutually exclusive. I draw from the formative interventions contemporary philosophy has made into the binary between humans and machines, and I indicate where identity markers such as race and gender have been largely omitted from the analysis.</p>
<p>While “machines and humans are often taken to be in opposition,” philosopher Glen A. Mazis writes in <em>Humans, Animals, Machines: Blurring Boundaries</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>These three realms, I would contend, can only be thought through together. The boundaries of the human, animal, and machine overlap, dance within each other, and separate, or maybe they should separate at certain key moments, but these lines or arabesques have been barely drawn or even traced out for the intricacy and beauty of their movements.<sup>[<a href="#footnote_17_2630" id="identifier_17_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Mazis, 6.">18</a>]</sup> </p></blockquote>
<p>The connections between the human, animal, and the machine that “separate” but also “overlap” with one another at “key moments” prove to make the idea of the human both stable and unstable. Mazis also notes: “Yet, what seems most striking is that we have not really thought through globally the characteristics of the machine, whether machines are evolving in their characteristics, and what exactly their relationship is to human being.”<sup>[<a href="#footnote_18_2630" id="identifier_18_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Ibid., 3.">19</a>]</sup> Mazis’s question about the machine prompts vital insights into the “global” characteristics of the machine and the evolution of its “relationship to human being.” However, Mazis’s critique fails to question the category of human. Unlike Chun’s articulation, Mazis’s critique rests on the assumption of a stable and non-racialized human category. This lack of a racial critique can be found in other studies on the human, animal, and machine divide. The collection <em>The Boundaries of Humanity: Humans, Animals, Machines</em>, edited by James J. Sheehan and Morton Sosna, contains neither mention of a critique of the liberal human subject nor an analysis of race.<sup>[<a href="#footnote_19_2630" id="identifier_19_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="James J. Sheehan and Morton Sosna, eds., The Boundaries of Humanity: Humans, Animals, Machines (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1991).">20</a>]</sup> Both books explicitly take on the question of the human/animal/machine and engage with Descartes and other philosophers, yet they critique neither the construction of the human nor racialization as analytic.<br />

<strong>The Human</strong></p>
<p>If we turn to the human, what will we find? As an intervention into the scholarship on humans, machines, and animals, Sylvia Wynter submits that the human was congealed through inhuman racial conquest and denigration. Wynter is expressly interested in race, and her argument centers on the colonial encounter as a way for the West to configure the “descriptive statement of the human.”<sup>[<a href="#footnote_20_2630" id="identifier_20_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Sylvia Wynter, &ldquo;Unsettling the Coloniality of Being/Power/Truth/Freedom: Towards the Human, After Man, Its Overrepresentation&mdash;An Argument,&rdquo; CR: The New Centennial Review 3, no. 3 (2003): 281.">21</a>]</sup> In particular, Wynter shows how the human was not only a racialized subject utilized to separate Africans and Native Americans from Europeans and Euro-Americans, and thereby to justify the colonial conquest, but that it also was “overrepresented” as “Man.” Wynter argues that Western imperialism</p>
<blockquote><p>thereby [came] to invent, label, and institutionalize the indigenous peoples of the Americas as well as the transported enslaved Black Africans as the physical referent of the projected irrational/subrational Human Other to its civic-humanist, rational self-conception. The West would therefore remain unable, from then on, to conceive of an Other to what it calls human—an Other, therefore, to its correlated postulates of power, truth, freedom. All other modes of being human would instead have to be seen not as the alternative modes of being human that they are “out there,” but adaptively, as the lack of the West’s ontologically absolute self-description.<sup>[<a href="#footnote_21_2630" id="identifier_21_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Ibid., 282.">22</a>]</sup> </p></blockquote>
<p>“As Wynter describes, the Western idea of the human was a project that instituted indigenous peoples and Black Africans as Human Others. The Other could never fit the description of the human. The process of inventing and institutionalizing indigenous and enslaved Black Africans was a process that had to maintain a certain logic of the “human.”</p>
<p>However, despite all her interventions, Wynter does not build on the human/animal analytic or the relation of the human to machines. She cites Gregory Bateson, a key figure in the theory of cybernetics, but she does not mention cybernetics herself. Wynter does include a brief mention of “Asian subjugation,” and it is this juncture that connects Wynter’s scholarship with further repairing theories of the human and racialization that build upon the study of the human/machine/animal encounter.<sup>[<a href="#footnote_22_2630" id="identifier_22_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Ibid., 267.">23</a>]</sup> </p>
<p><strong>How We Became (Post)human</strong></p>
<p>If Wynter’s explication of colonialism’s role in the creation of the liberal human subject as Man was a critical intervention in the philosophical discourses of the human, the emergence of the posthuman and the cyborg, the fusing of human and machine, prompts further questions on issues of race, gender, and difference. Theoretical discourses of the posthuman and cyborg emerged in the 1990s with monographs and scholarly essays published into the present, by science and technology studies scholars such as Lucy Suchman, Donna Haraway, N. Katherine Hayles, Ronald Kline, and Cary Wolfe.<sup>[<a href="#footnote_23_2630" id="identifier_23_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Donna Haraway, Simians, Cyborgs, and Women: The Reinvention of Nature (New York: Routledge, 1990); N. Katherine Hayles, How We Became Posthuman: Virtual Bodies in Cybernetics, Literature, and Informatics (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999); Ronald Kline, &ldquo;Where Are the Cyborgs in Cybernetics?,&rdquo; Social Studies of Science 39 (2009): 331.">24</a>]</sup> In his book <em>What Is Posthumanism?</em>, Wolfe traces how the term “posthumanism” worked itself into the humanities and social sciences during the mid-1990s, although the term actually goes back to Michel Foucault’s articulation of the human.</p>
<p>Unlike previous philosophical work on the relations between human and machine as discrete entities, the many varieties of posthumanism have in common a concern with the transgression between the human and machine. Hayles writes, “although the posthuman differs in its articulations, a common theme is the union of the human with the intelligent machine,” and “the posthuman view configures human being so that it can be seamlessly articulated with intelligent machines. In the posthuman, there are no essential differences or absolute demarcations between bodily existence and computer simulation, cybernetic mechanism and biological organisms, robot teleology and human goals.”<sup>[<a href="#footnote_24_2630" id="identifier_24_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Hayles, How We Became Posthuman, 3.">25</a>]</sup> Haraway formatively centered a feminist critique of the human/machine analytic based on the cyborg. Haraway writes, “The cyborg appears in myth precisely where the boundary between human and animal is transgressed”—it is a “theorized and fabricated [hybrid] of machine and organism; in short, we are cyborgs.”<sup>[<a href="#footnote_25_2630" id="identifier_25_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Haraway, Simians, Cyborgs, and Women, 152.">26</a>]</sup> </p>
<p>In the move to the posthuman, theorists critique the notion of the liberal human subject through analysis of gender (although some varieties, such as transhumanism, may uphold the liberal human subject and elide gender). For example, Haraway’s “Cyborg Manifesto” published in 1983, formatively transformed feminist critique in her theorization of the cyborg, and Hayles theorized the gender and sexuality of the Turing Test in her introduction to the posthuman. While Haraway in particular figures in women of color analysis in her “cyborg manifesto,” further theorization involving racialization and the cyborg should be added to this scholarship to build on the insightful attention that Haraway, Hayles, and other scholars have paid to the intersectional gender politics of the human/machine analytic.</p>
<p>I find my robot most in queer and feminist theorist Jasbir Puar’s response to the debates between intersectionality and assemblages; her critique provides vital insights and provocations. In her essay “‘I Would Rather Be a Cyborg than a Goddess’: Becoming-Intersectional in Assemblage Theory,” Puar argues that assemblage theory (informed by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari) and intersectional theory (informed by Kimberlé Crenshaw) should not be oppositional theoretical paradigms, but “frictional.” Puar’s large project utilizes assemblages as “relations of patterns” however she notes that amongst many definitions, she is being more interested in “what assemblages do.”<sup>[<a href="#footnote_26_2630" id="identifier_26_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Jasbir K. Puar, &ldquo;&lsquo;I Would Rather Be a Cyborg than a Goddess&rsquo;: Becoming-Intersectional of Assemblage Theory,&rdquo; PhiloSOPHIA: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy 2, no. 1 (2012): 49&ndash;66.">27</a>]</sup> For our purposes in this search, I want to focus on—in what Puar offers as one example in a list of assemblage interventions—“Assemblages do not privilege bodies as human, nor as residing within a human/animal binary.”<sup>[<a href="#footnote_27_2630" id="identifier_27_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Ibid. 49&ndash;66.">28</a>]</sup> Puar contends the usefulness and necessity of intersectionality, noting however that intersectionality oftentimes elides other axes of difference, such as sexuality, with its focus on race. Intersectionality can also, according to Puar and other theorists, perpetuate the reification of women of color as perpetual subjects of difference. Moreover, Puar offers that the “dominant feminist method” of intersectionality may prompt characterizations of other methods, such as “assemblage,” as “problematic.”<sup>[<a href="#footnote_28_2630" id="identifier_28_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Ibid. 49&ndash;66.">29</a>]</sup> Inspired by Puar’s articulation, when searching, a project on race and robots requires intersectionality and other frames.</p>
<p>For Puar, posthumanist feminist scholars offer differing accounts of the subject because the “liminality of bodily matter cannot be captured by intersectional subject positioning.” Puar positions science and technology scholars such as Haraway and Barad as posthumanist and theorists of assemblages in the juxtaposition of intersectionality and assemblages. Central to Puar’s claim is a return to Haraway and the “cyborg” or “goddess.” She writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>To return to the title of this piece, and the juxtaposition that Haraway (unfortunately, but presciently) renders, would I really rather be a cyborg than a goddess? The former hails the future in a teleological technological determinism—culture—that seems not only over determined, but also exceptionalizes our current technologies. The latter—nature—is embedded in the racialized matriarchal mythos of feminist reclamation narratives.<sup>[<a href="#footnote_29_2630" id="identifier_29_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Ibid. 49&ndash;66.">30</a>]</sup> </p></blockquote>
<p>Puar opts to choose a cyborgian cyborg; although she still asks if a cyborg-goddess is possible. Like much of women of color critique, Puar posits the importance of both intersectional and assemblage theory and makes a critical intervention within posthumanism. Posthumanist scholars do not examine the body for racial differences and the marks of stratification; these are the concerns of racial theorists. For the posthumanist scholar, what is of concern is when information loses its body, and the stakes of embodiment in the posthuman.<sup>[<a href="#footnote_30_2630" id="identifier_30_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Hayles, How We Became Posthuman, 3.">31</a>]</sup> Is a cyborg-goddess possible? Indeed, Puar offers an important theoretical development in the study of racialization, and also highlights the gaping differences between posthumanist scholars and scholars of representation. Like Puar, I ask for a “frictional” relationship with racial theory and posthuman theorization.</p>
<p><strong>Re-returning to Haraway’s “A Cyborg Manifesto”</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“The nimble fingers of ‘Oriental’ women…</p>
<p>Ironically, it might be the unnatural cyborg women making chips in Asia and spiral dancing in Santa Rita jail whose constructed unities will guide effective oppositional strategies.”<br />
—Haraway<sup>[<a href="#footnote_31_2630" id="identifier_31_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Haraway, 178. ">32</a>]</sup> </p></blockquote>
<p>Per Puar’s analysis, I re-return to Haraway’s “Cyborg Manifesto,” to find more specifically traces of the Asian and Asian American and/as robot. I find two lines that evoke this dialectical connection between Asian and/as automaton. In Haraway’s essay, she is laboring, the close connection of the historical connotations of the robot as such. Yet what is the parallel between the women spiral dancing in the Santa Rita jail and the cyborg women making chips? <em>Nimble fingers</em>. Various scholars have critiqued Haraway’s conflation of these two groups of women as cyborg.<sup>[<a href="#footnote_32_2630" id="identifier_32_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Jeffrey A. Ow, &ldquo;The Revenge of the Yellow Faced Terminator: The Rape of Digital Geishas and the Colonization of Cyber Coolies in 3D Realms&rsquo; Shadow Warrior.&rdquo; in Asian America.Net: Ethnicity, Nationalism, and Cyberspace edited by Sau-ling Wong and Rachel Lee; (New York, Routledge, 2003) 250.">33</a>]</sup> Additionally, Haraway has since revised her position in regards to including both groups of women—spiral dancing feminists and Asian women laborers—conflated both as “we” and equal proximity to the cyborg.<sup>[<a href="#footnote_33_2630" id="identifier_33_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Constance Penley, Andrew Ross and Donna Haraway, &ldquo;Cyborgs At Large, Interview with Donna Haraway.&rdquo; Social Text No. 25/26 (1990): 17.">34</a>]</sup> However, I want to turn to the cover image painting of Haraway’s <em>Simians, Cyborgs, and Women</em> by Lynn Randolph.</p>
<div id="attachment_2637" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://sfonline.barnard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/cyborg.jpg" alt="Painting by Lynn Randolph" width="620" height="806" class="size-full wp-image-2637" srcset="http://sfonline.barnard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/cyborg.jpg 620w, http://sfonline.barnard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/cyborg-231x300.jpg 231w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Painting by Lynn Randolph, cover image of Haraway&#8217;s <em>Simians, Cyborgs, and Women</em>.</p></div>
<p>In particular, I point to the artist’s statement about the painting, which she says was inspired directly by lines from the manifesto. As Randolph writes: “Haraway’s description of Asian women with nimble fingers, working in enterprise zones for very little remuneration stuck in my head. I had recently met a young Chinese woman, Grace Li, who was one of my late husband’s sociology students at the University of Houston… I asked Grace if she would pose for me and she agreed.”<sup>[<a href="#footnote_34_2630" id="identifier_34_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Lynn Randolph, &ldquo;Modest Witness: A Painter&rsquo;s Collaboration with Donna Haraway,&rdquo; 2009, available at the artist&rsquo;s website.">35</a>]</sup> </p>
<p>I argue elsewhere, in my analysis of the 1960s robotic art of new media artist Nam June Paik, that Asian American artists deploy a strategy of what I call “racial recalibration”—a racial formation that occurs through aesthetic tinkering, hacking, and recreating with emergent technologies that re-wires racial knowledge of the Asian and Asian American as robot.<sup>[<a href="#footnote_35_2630" id="identifier_35_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Rhee, Ibid.">36</a>]</sup> I want to extend this analysis of recalibration to consider how the painting of Haraway’s cyborg offers us a dialectical connection between the machine and Asian/Asian American.</p>
<p>The painting includes said model Grace Li, in the center, typing on a keyboard, with the computer board on her chest and a backdrop of various scientific and computer activities hanging like an artwork behind her. It is a science fictional rendering of another world. The Asian cyborg feminist here is kin with animals: a tiger headdress rests atop her head, the skeleton of the animal visible and lightened. Above are a galaxy of stars, while below are sand dunes, and it does seem like this cyborg-goddess is ruling the world. Randolph elaborates on her painting: “I put the DIPswitches of the computer board on her chest as if it were a part of her dress. A giant keyboard sits in front of her and her hands are poised to play with the cosmos, words, games, images, and unlimited interactions and activities. <em>She can do anything</em>.”<sup>[<a href="#footnote_36_2630" id="identifier_36_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Randolph, &ldquo;Modest Witness.&rdquo; Emphasis mine.">37</a>]</sup> </p>
<p>“She can do anything”: Randolph transforms the Asian woman worker into a science fictional cyborg that utilizes technological access for her own agentic activities. Randolph emphasizes that both the Asian cyborg-goddess and the tiger “look directly at the viewer.” She writes: “The underlying intent was to create a figure that could visually do what Haraway was describing as the potential for re-figuring our consciousness.”<sup>[<a href="#footnote_37_2630" id="identifier_37_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Ibid.">38</a>]</sup> In considering the historical materiality of gendered racialization that are crucial to its articulation and, as Barad writes, re-turning to the image from Haraway, to reread again, and to see the racial potential through which we can also see diffraction, the light.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: Theory as Technology</strong></p>
<p>In discussing science and technology studies, Charis Thompson points out that fields such as queer, race, and ethnic studies came to STS much later than fields such as the study of scientific knowledge (SSK, 1970s) and actor network theory (ANT, 1980s), “but they interact vigorously with them, while adding new areas of focus and new analytic resources.”<sup>[<a href="#footnote_38_2630" id="identifier_38_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Charis Thompson, Making Parents: The Ontological Choreography of Artificial Reproductive Technologies, (Cambridge: MIT, 2005), 49.">39</a>]</sup> Understanding how, as Thompson writes, race, and gender, and sexuality, and disability, and various other axes meet helps me understand where to find my robot, and the challenges to finding her. Models written by Thompson, Puar, and others create the theoretical technologies that offers multiple locations for analysis. Scholarly writing can often alienate people of color, queer people, and women, and the study of technology often excludes minority participation. As race must be theoretized within a science and technology studies lens, theory can also be understood in a similar way through the technological. And in doing so, we can add “new areas of focus” such as the analytic of race and Puar’s “Cyborg-Goddess.”<sup>[<a href="#footnote_39_2630" id="identifier_39_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Lisa Nakamura, Cybertypes: Race, Ethnicity, and Identity on the Internet (London: Routledge, 2002), 8.">40</a>]</sup> Like Thompson, Lisa Nakamura rereads the late African American feminist scholar Barbara Christian and echoes her disciplinary concerns; in Nakamura’s words, Christian “asserts the technology of literary theory was made deliberately mystifying and dense to exclude minority participation.”<sup>[<a href="#footnote_40_2630" id="identifier_40_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Ibid.">41</a>]</sup> Citing theory as technology, Nakamura’s reading of Christian recognizes that scholarship is also technological and can be utilized for resistance. In <em>Cybertypes</em>, Nakamura writes about how critical theory works as “a technology or a machine that produces a particular kind of discourse.”<sup>[<a href="#footnote_41_2630" id="identifier_41_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Ibid., 3.">42</a>]</sup> </p>
<p>If theory and academic writing are a “machine” or a “technology,” I hope for more technologies for the social good. In acknowledging intellectual debts, we can understand that neither technology nor theory emerge from a void. Is it our work, then, not simply to introduce correctives to existing theory, but to push forward, to seek theoretical frameworks that make Haraway’s and Randolph’s Asian feminist cyborg more than a figure of science fiction, but a feminist STS reality? We should seek theories that “interact vigorously” with one another, frictionally, in which boundaries “bleed,” and in order to build a world that is “far from disheartening.”<sup>[<a href="#footnote_42_2630" id="identifier_42_2630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Lisa Nakamura, Digitizing Race: Visual Cultures of the Internet (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2008), 208.">43</a>]</sup> At the theoretical gaps, and frictions, is where solder melts and sediments/there, at the intersections of boundaries and de-wires/re-wires/I realize I find traces of her. </p>
