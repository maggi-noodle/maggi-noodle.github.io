When the work was done and the sun returned we would venture out to see what changes had been made, but for now we stayed inside where it was warm and safe.
We turned the heat all the way up and snuggled under the covers. The warmth and humidity created a tropical microclimate. Our own world, we were the gods here.
    <br><br>
A ring at the doorbell. A pause. We looked at each other. Who would be the one to leave the bed to answer it? It was my turn this time. I left the bed and my sweat began to cool immediately, leaving me shivering.<br><br>
There was a dry mister in a beige overcoat. A mysteriously dry mister.<br><br>
I clicked the “call” button, “Excuse me, what do you want?”<br><br>
He didn’t answer, just continued to stand there. I could hear my own digitized voice echoing back outside, his avoidance was deliberate. He looked straight into the cctv camera, staring at me with an expectant gaze through his round spectacles. He had no way of seeing me, but I could still feel his gaze.
I was afraid to go outside, but at the same time I felt compelled to go to him. Ever since I had opened the video feed, he had not blinked a single time. I tried to speak again, to ask him another question, but words could not leave my mouth.<br><br>
Resigned, I put on my robe and slippers. My co-diety murmured, half asleep, “Who is it?” “I don’t know, I have to go down I guess.”
I braced myself for the biting cold that awaited me with the mister on the other side of that door. I clenched the pores of my skin into tight goosebumps and gnashed my teeth, releasing calcium grits into my dry mouth. I reached for the door.<br><br></a></li></th>

The man was gone, the sun was out, the doorstep was dry. On the welcome mat a business card: At every level, a calamity. At every stage, a miracle. I picked it up–– an address on the other side, 7 Eurasian 94666.<br><br>
Warm wind blew up my silky robes. The neighbor, out mowing his lawn, gave me a friendly wave. I lightly closed the door and a gust slammed it loudly shut.
I went back upstairs, back under the covers with my heater still cranked up to the max. Alone and warm with the book I had been reading: Playing God: The Illustrated Guide to Universe Instantiation, Chapter 6 1/2: What happens to reality when the substrate over which it is instantiated is removed?<br><br>
I could swear I had had someone waiting for me in bed. A co-diety, a lover, there was this whole history we had together. A romantic dinner gone awry, a traffic jam turned into a karaoke contest, an inside joke about soaps. Clearly it was all false. There was no one in the bed. I must have constructed an entire narrative while checking the door.<br><br>
Since I had started reading this book my mind seemed to have developed a life of its own. It had been running out of control, overpowering every other aspect of my being. While the ability to create reality was appealing, I might not have pursued it had I realized it might damage the cohesion of my own.<br></a></li></th>

“Get the physics engine set up right and the rest just falls out.” Too bad the physics is always the finickiest part with its self organization at large sales, and pseudo-randomness at smaller ones. This time it was a dense matter accumulation in the N7 sector causing an integer overflow. The entire region filled with zeroes. Looks like another night of debugging... Not that there was much else to do on a murkily pescillant evening like this one. I put on the rain to keep any nosy humans out of the workspace. No need to create any new religions for universe v2893.0.3. And to think that silly human Leibniz thought I got it right with version 1.0...<br><br>
Unzeroeing the space was easy enough, but it took a few thousand replays before I was able to spot where my sparsity enforcement failed. The crashing and snapping outside redoubled and I was thankful that I had ended up staying in. In any case, the error was much more subtle than I had anticipated, it could have taken me all night to rectify. It was a particularly rare set of coincidences that allowed the accumulation to happen, but it would certainly occur again if the exception handler was left unchanged. I was in the middle of listing the required conditionals when a large pescetic entity broke, oversaturating my energy regulator. To avoid frying the banks, computation was halted midーcompilation.<br><br>
I re-clicked the system and generated a report. It was an absolute mess. Causality flaws, continuity errors, plot holes... people would be questioning their sanity for quite awhile after this one. Most alarming however, was a containment breach. It seemed that my documentation had leaked into the program under the form of an instruction manual for the creation of universes. I had to act immediately. My hobbyist- class universe rendermachine could not handle any sub-instantiations, let alone the runaway recursions that would likely happen if one of my dumb humans tried to play god. The whole system would broil.<br><br>
I was able to delete all but one instance of the manual. For this last instance, a human had taken advantage of a plothole to read all the way up to the 6 1/2th chapter, acquiring Godwill that I could not simply contradict. I would have to convince them to give up universe-craft voluntarily. Or maybe I would end up convincing myself.<br><br>
In these cases I had a few tools at my disposal: Love, Piety, Destiny, Pride: the soft powers of the gods for when floods, earthquakes and fires would not do. To finagle this sort of maneuver requires very delicate manipulation and thorough understanding of my target. Sure, I have access to the exact positions of every atom of every molecule of every synapse of the human in question, but to sort the tangled and haphazardly evolved mess of seemingly unrelated tidbits into a cohesive psychological understanding was above my processing level. Especially if I wanted to play with its emotions enough to convince it to give up something as alluring as godhood. I needed to call on an outside power.<br><br>
I bimmed Zelrinne, that rich and kooky melon-ship captain who always had some gigas to spare so long as I could sit through her absurd conspiracy theories about supremum universes and how there was some kind of automated creator spirit that wove intangible memories through a hierarchy of simulations. According to her fallacious “as above so below” reasoning, our plane sat at some point in an infinite stack
of others, like a single flapjack in an infinite heap of pancakes, with syrup messily running down. Zelrinne rezzed up to the vizzy.
The gods sure are angry tonight! She greeted. I’ve had 9 pescetic ruptures in the local octant alone and getting reports of worse elsewhere! How hard are you hit?<br><br>
Pretty bad, I had a neighborhood rupture instantiate mid-compilation. Emergency shutdown procedures resulted in a containment breach with a high risk of runaway recursion.<br><br>
I’ll be right over.<br><br>
I liked Zelrinne. For all of her kookiness, there was also an intensity and tenderness in her presence. She was a gentle soul, willing to save my ass even if I was just a hobbyist-class universe simulator amidst a region saturated with enterprise and research-class equipment. For her, a universe was a universe was a universe. Even if it was just the pipe dream of a stoned frog drying over the dregs of Driscle Bay.
Within a few epicycles she arrived with render tube in hand, the spiral tips of her long tresque frizzling effervescently with leftover statics from the terrible storm that continued to rage outside the climate pod.<br><br>
Alright, lets save the world!<br><br>
I handed her the pointer to my human which she clicked into the tube’s beaconspace. We positioned our thodes and trodes, and said a quick prayer (whoever is listening, please will you do something about Entropy?) as we waited to load. 15%, 76%, 93%, 98%, 100%. Time to get our hands dirty.<br><br>
I braced myself for the dysphoric rush of entering a foreign qualia and losing all agency in my interactions. A passenger in a alien train, only I was the train. I’d done it a few times but never under this sort of duress. As I began to let my senses in I felt the absurd hairyness of the being I was inhabiting, the ability to sense something in the air that I called saltiness. I associated this “saltiness” with objects that my primitive system converted into energy through a painful and intrusive process. Most of my perceptive space however was dedicated to “sight”, a sense based on the bouncing wiggles of my simulation, currently focused intently on neatly organized rows of emergent squiggles which seemed to encode some kind of information that the humans created with intent.<br><br>
Forget the human experience, commed-in Zelrinne, you need to go deeper!<br><br>
I abstracted away the senses and did my best to experience this human on their own terms, as they would.<br><br>

At this point, we had spent so much time with each other in that bed that the whole room smelled of our flesh. Droplets of moisture condensed on the windows evaporating only in the small crack between the curtains where the sun shone through. Were it not for that
crack I would have no idea what time it was in the outside world, for here we ran on our own schedule, dividing moments into heartbeats and orgasmic spasms.<br><br>
I would estimate that it had been about a week since we had fallen into this hole, reading old Tantric texts out loud to each other on how to form harmonious union. Even as her eyelids grew heavy from the dictation, I kept going–– looking forward to the conclusion when we could actually unionize. I projected the pdf onto the wall and performed shadow puppetry as I read. I was living the text, contorting my body into the shape of a camel with its tail swung up when suddenly there was a blasted knock on the door. “I can get it,” I whispered lightly to her, grazing her sweet mounds.

I stepped out to pick up the mail and waved to Mr. Bobertson who lived in the house next door. We attended the same yoga class on Wednesdays. Only one letter, from the theatre at 7 Eurasian Way. They wanted me again for their new season, this time for parody adaptation of The Passion of the Christ. I was cast for the role of “Sex(y) God”. I rolled my eyes and headed back indoors.

    <th><li class='red'><a href=#><br>I groaned to be writing such trash. But I had to make a few bucks to feed the little spawn I was raising alone–– a consequence of a gorgeous but disastrous research summit. Inspired by one of our more eminent colleague’s talk on The New Erotica: Setting the Stage for a Post-Orgasmic Universe, we sauntered back to their deluxe suite to participate in one of the most productive inspiration orgies of all time. Unfortunately, instead of producing a boundary shattering piece of erotic non-fiction I was left with a fertilized ovary that blossomed into a lifetime of responsibility. <br><br>

And so, I had fallen down a rung in the hierarchy of love-researchers and found myself writing boring fuck stories for the barely literate masses who still enjoyed pornography in printed form. At $0.15 a word though, it was at least enough to sustain me and my “greatest literary achievement ever.” Plus, it was easy. After carefully writing the first few paragraphs and ensuring my readers’ critical faculties had been surpassed by more primitive considerations, I had free reign. If my characters fell apart, if I continually pulled the rug out from under them, it wasn’t a big deal so long as the words kept people wet, sweat, and tickled. <br><br>

Still, I had ambitions. I was an intellectual. And thus I continued to pursue my academic career. I felt like such a phony, cradling my baby as I theorized from a hypothetical space of radical sensuo-sexual liberation, but I had to press on, to construct a career for myself, to create the orgasmic universe I had momentarily glimpsed that one fateful eve. Recently, I had been researching a new emergent failure mode within technological advancements in romance known as ghosting. All my friends complained and were confused about this phenomenon, but I was able to approach it with an air of scientific indifference. To properly conduct my research, I forced myself to go on many dates, most of them bad. All of them came to the same outcome regardless of the bearability of the other party: one after another, we would gaze into each other’s eyes for a few seconds at a time. Our pupils might dilate in each others’ presence, and then after at most three weeks, I would cut off contact if they hadn’t done so already.<br><br>

Now, with this budding ability to create actual literal universes, the investigations I had thrown myself into with such abandon seemed so trivial that I could barely muster the mental cohesion to care. It was my overwhelming streak of completionism, the same one that earned me my PhD in retro-speculative post-vagino-eroticism, the same one that I knew would force me to raise this child into adulthood, that drove me to carry on my research. Until I had a definitive explanation of the mechanisms of Ghosting, or at the very least a publishable monograph on the topic, I would press on with these experiments.<br><br>

A melodious chime on my phone, a new match on SquashSmashSqueal. Time for the next case study. We always went to the same Chinese restaurant, Harmonious Union, and I always ordered the pineapple rice. This was both to ensure my experiments were conducted under the same conditions, to isolate the variables, and because this restaurant’s pineapple rice was the best in the entire west village.<br><br>

This man showed up in a beige overcoat and round glasses. His lips were scrunched as if he was perpetually smelling something foul. The bizarrely unique man somehow had an air of familiarity, though I couldn’t place where I had seen him. Moments after we sat down he got straight to business. “I am Edwin Schrödinger.” he declared, “After reading his magnum opus My View of the World, I knew I had actually written it myself.”<br><br>

“Wow, what’s it like being such an eminent mind? Your view of the world is so unique, your perceptive abilities so sharp! I wish I could be inside you to experience the universe through your unique outlook.”<br><br>

All these men were the same, the one who was “actually really Banksy”, the one who “pissed the entire Mekong river”, the one who “invented the avocado emoji”, the one who “knitted Steve Job’s turtleneck”, the one who “kept the three rulers of the entire world monetary system in a terrarium and sustained them on wiggling white weevils”. I stroked their embellished egos to see if their personal fictions could take on worthwhile narrative structure. They never did, but this time things were different.<br><br>

“I know it seems absurd, but recently I have been trying to defend my crowning literary achievement. As much as I respect the Hindu people for their invention of time travel, I cannot forgive the blatant plagiarism they committed when they republished my work as their Vedantas.” 
<br><br>
He declared this in his heavy Polish accent. I could not be sure if it was a riff or a serious, nor could I be sure if his accent was real because of the exaggerated way his mouth moved when he spoke. He always looked like he was chewing, regardless of what activity his strong mandibles were engaged in.<br><br>

“And you, what is your wraison d’estre?”<br><br>

I decided to steer clear from revealing my new goddesshood to shield his precious mortal ego.<br><br>

“I’m studying ghosting, a recent process by which even promising new relationships spontaneously fade.”<br><br>

“Ahh yes, I can perhaps provide some insight: As entropy in the universe increases, simplifications to social network graphs must be made to maintain computability of the system. Otherwise, there will be runaway exponential explosions and serious lag times will ensue. Low weighted connections, or edges, are thus pruned to keep complexity at bay. These are often associated with newly formed relationships.”
<br><br>
“So love is impossible in the modern world?”<br><br>

“In the current version, yes, but I suspect the divine programmer will quash this bug shortly.”<br><br>

Under most circumstances this sort of digital new age evangelism would have turned me off completely, but since I had recently ascended to godhood myself it made enough sense to be true, even if there was no way I could publish this sort of explanation.<br><br>

I decided to go home with him, maybe sex would yield some insights. I didn’t know what else to do anyways, and this was the experimental procedure after all. The act was merely symbolic, barely qualifying as sex, and he insisted keeping his overcoat and glasses on the whole time. When he finished, he reached immediately for his pipe which he puffed long and ponderously. I was about to fall asleep out of boredom when we heard a knock on the door. <br><br>

“I’ll get it.”
<br><br>
I left the room, just me again. Was this situation really fit for a goddess? Maybe I should just forget about the ghosting and worry about the godding.<br><br>

The knock again.<br><br>

I walked through the kitchen and peeped through the hole. The same man with the round spectacles, beige overcoat and vaguely disgusted face. Wasn’t I in his house?  <br><br>

As I was reaching out to turn the knob, a wave of nausea passed over me.  It was an overwhelming feeling of deja vu, my mind reaching in on itself, pulling itself apart in an attempt to find the non existent memories.

The nausea and confusion was too much for me. I ejected. These humans sure had a lot tied up into their reproductive strategies. And maybe my method of solving the wave equation quantization problem by dampening social complexity explosion was a little too hacky to stick.
Zelrinne was click-clacking away frantically at the input center.<br><br>

“This is bad, really bad. The containment breach is global”<br><br>

Just then, a chiming at my visitor entrance.<br><br>

“No matter what, DON’T ANSWER IT”<br><br>

The vizz activated. Somehow a three dimensional human entity had managed to occupy the space. It had that same beige overcoat and round spectacles.<br><br>

“What — how is it here?”<br><br>

“There's a level mismatch, if we aren’t extremely careful we will broil our physics into our own un-existence”<br><br>

Information density in my universe seemed to all be converging into a single subzone, by the local addressing system: 7 Eurasian 94666, an abandoned theatre with three stories, each with its own rotting red curtains. Somehow, every single door was opening to this address.<br><br>

Zelrinne removed the armsack from which she usually procured her ticklefizz and bubblebrains when we were not in crisis mode, that until recently had seemed permanently attached to her. She stretched it into a long monoluminescent cloak with an antiquated-looking bifocal vizz-apparatus. <br><br>

“This might be the most important thing we ever do.”<br><br>

She fitted them on me very carefully, but they felt very uncomfortable. I felt my body contorting, changing its nature. It was an unpleasant and disorienting feeling.<br><br>

“I’m sorry I have to do this to you, but it is absolutely necessary”<br><br>

She pinged in a sequence and moved it into the runtime queue. I began to understand the gravity of my fate as my entire experience shifted from being myself to being some creation by some entity that I had been all along. I found myself somewhere wet, dark and warm. I was no longer a god, that was for certain, but what was I?  A fresh human, somehow rendered retroactively at version 1.0 of the universe, banished for life to a lower realm.<br><br>

Here, time was measured in years, a unit defined by the celestial mechanics I had once developed, but was now inscribed in. After a few of these had passed, I was used to my new, complicated existence, the inefficiently designed sensory inputs, the necessity of eating, and most incomprehensibly of all, the hairs. There were just so many of them and they seemed to serve absolutely no purpose. After an awkward in-between period, the cloak became that beige overcoat and round spectacles which had a habit of reoccurring. I knew I could not remove them, as doing so would certainly rupture the delicate neural connections that supported my existence in this primitive universe. 		<br><br>

Once I had accustomed myself to human existence, I began to focus on understanding the bug that had once plagued me as a programmer and now plagued me as a subroutine of the program. It was indeed a complicated knot in the code, rendered more difficult to untie by my absurd lack of administrator privileges. Still, I knew, or at least I hoped, that Zelrinne was up above watching me and could implement the changes I came up with. This was confirmed during the first rainstorm when I walked out and every single raindrop avoided me precisely.<br><br>

And so, with nothing else to do but breathe air and study physics I figured out how to quantize my waves using some clever but computationally efficient linear algebra. And since I was writing the physics, I might as well take credit for discovering it. I became known as a groundbreaking physicist and slowly accumulated more administrator privileges in the form of assistants and collaborators. Finally, after about 15 years of tinkering, I lived in a beautiful, bugless universe, with processing power to spare, which I used to develop ornate fish and insects. I created a nice documentation for it all, and then since there was nothing godly left to do, I began to explore what earthly pleasures existed in my own little world. I left the oppressive but regimented country in which I had done most of my work for a freer one where I started a cozy little 3-pod with two sweet and kind wives. The other humans looked down on us for they did not mate in this pattern, but how was I supposed to know this? It was good for awhile, and then they died, and I continued on my way. Would I continue to exist like this indefinitely? <br><br>

I wandered aimlessly, floated and bobbed, soaking in the beautiful 1.57 E+33 Plank length per inch universe in full resolution. I was so proud of my work. If only I could get back home I would most certainly get a grant for a top-of-the-line research level simulator. And yet here I was, stuck in my own simulation. And so I took photographs and made films, sampled the wide variety of psychoactive compounds that were available and learned to make time flexible as the Hindus did using the forward-looking caterpillar and rearward-looking butterfly. As I made my way through the various spiritual traditions people here practiced I began to wonder if every universe, or at least every stable one had some fallen angel, someone on the ground to make sure everything ran smoothly. And if so, did they all want to go back as badly as I did?<br><br>

As my cursory sampling of earth continued, I developed a method to interview other humans and see if my creation was satisfied and if I was satisfied in my creation, but mostly for entertainment. The app, SmashSquashSqueal, was an instant success, and it provided decades of fun. Each of these humans was a unique distillation of an arbitrary past, unlike my old people who had all undergone the same optimal maturation routine. While I suffered from a deep and cosmic ennui, at least I might never get bored.<br><br>

One evening I found myself in a hole in the wall Chinese restaurant in the west village with a youngish woman of fading intellectuality. She seemed relatively unremarkable, a typical human at that phase in their life where they begin to feel the banality of existence closing in on them. But one thing was different: unlike the other humans I had connected to I was unable to command the same sort of attention from her that I was used to. Most humans could intuitively sense my godliness, why did she not care? The scent of her steamed pineapple rice wafted into my nostrils, familiar to me though I had never smelled it before. I did my best to hold her attention, revealing as much about my true identity as I could while still being believable. Only when we got up did I remember the evening with the strange man in the brown overcoat who was now me. Maybe this time it could be different. It was storming heavily so we took a taxicab to my place. She insisted on having sex even after I revealed that I was a never-nude. The obsession with abstracted reproductive acts no longer confused me, but I was still disgusted by it. I did the minimum and reached for my pipe. Just then, a knock at the door. Something in my body changed, I was finally ready to transcend, to break free from the shell that both protected and imprisoned me.<br><br>

“I’ll get it”<br><br>

I grabbed her by the arm.<br><br>

“Don’t!”<br><br>

I took off my overcoat and spectacles and she stood next to the bed shocked, staring at the luminescing raw ports on my body, which tingled and spasmed, feeling the air for the first time.<br><br> 

“I’m sorry I have to do this to you, but the fate of the universe depends on it”<br><br>

I draped the overcoat over her shoulders and put the spectacles on her face. I folded her up in the jacket, which became thinner and paperier with each fold, in the end giving a beautifully bound folio book.<br><br>

The knock at the door continued. It was my turn to open it.
