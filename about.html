    <li><p style="color:#99ebff"><br>It had been raining for awhile. The raindrops clicked in the puddles and wet cement. God’s million little fingers hard at work editing. When the work was done and the sun returned we would venture out to see what changes had been made, but for now we stayed inside where it was warm and safe.
We turned the heat all the way up and snuggled under the covers. The warmth and humidity created a tropical microclimate. Our own world, we were the gods here.
    <br><br>
A ring at the doorbell. A pause. We looked at each other. Who would be the one to leave the bed to answer it? It was my turn this time. I left the bed and my sweat began to cool immediately, leaving me shivering.<br><br>
There was a dry mister in a beige overcoat. A mysteriously dry mister.<br><br>
I clicked the “call” button, “Excuse me, what do you want?”<br><br>
He didn’t answer, just continued to stand there. I could hear my own digitized voice echoing back outside, his avoidance was deliberate. He looked straight into the cctv camera, staring at me with an expectant gaze through his round spectacles. He had no way of seeing me, but I could still feel his gaze.
I was afraid to go outside, but at the same time I felt compelled to go to him. Ever since I had opened the video feed, he had not blinked a single time. I tried to speak again, to ask him another question, but words could not leave my mouth.<br><br>
Resigned, I put on my robe and slippers. My co-diety murmured, half asleep, “Who is it?” “I don’t know, I have to go down I guess.”
I braced myself for the biting cold that awaited me with the mister on the other side of that door. I clenched the pores of my skin into tight goosebumps and gnashed my teeth, releasing calcium grits into my dry mouth. I reached for the door.<br><br></li>


    <ul> <p style="color:#ffff80"> I opened the door. It was not as frigid as I had imagined. While my body found this to be a relief, the core of the reality that I had constructed had just been shattered, leaving me with nothing to hold onto.<br><br>
The man was gone, the sun was out, the doorstep was dry. On the welcome mat a business card: At every level, a calamity. At every stage, a miracle. I picked it up–– an address on the other side, 7 Eurasian 94666.<br><br>
Warm wind blew up my silky robes. The neighbor, out mowing his lawn, gave me a friendly wave. I lightly closed the door and a gust slammed it loudly shut.
I went back upstairs, back under the covers with my heater still cranked up to the max. Alone and warm with the book I had been reading: Playing God: The Illustrated Guide to Universe Instantiation, Chapter 6 1/2: What happens to reality when the substrate over which it is instantiated is removed?<br><br>
I could swear I had had someone waiting for me in bed. A co-diety, a lover, there was this whole history we had together. A romantic dinner gone awry, a traffic jam turned into a karaoke contest, an inside joke about soaps. Clearly it was all false. There was no one in the bed. I must have constructed an entire narrative while checking the door.<br><br>
        Since I had started reading this book my creativity seemed to have developed a mind of its own. It had been running out of control, overpowering every other aspect of my being. While the ability to create reality was appealing, I might not have pursued it had I realized it might damage the cohesion of my own.<br></ul>
