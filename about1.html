God’s million little fingers hard at work editing. When the work was done and the sun returned we would venture out to see what changes had been made, but for now we stayed inside where it was warm and safe.
We turned the heat all the way up and snuggled under the covers. The warmth and humidity created a tropical microclimate. Our own world, we were the gods here.

A ring at the doorbell. A pause. We looked at each other. Who would be the one to leave the bed to answer it? It was my turn this time. I left the bed and my sweat began to cool immediately, leaving me shivering.<br><br>
There was a dry mister in a beige overcoat. A mysteriously dry mister.<br><br>
I clicked the “call” button, “Excuse me, what do you want?”<br><br>
He didn’t answer, just continued to stand there. I could hear my own digitized voice echoing back outside, his avoidance was deliberate. He looked straight into the cctv camera, staring at me with an expectant gaze through his round spectacles. He had no way of seeing me, but I could still feel his gaze.
I was afraid to go outside, but at the same time I felt compelled to go to him. Ever since I had opened the video feed, he had not blinked a single time. I tried to speak again, to ask him another question, but words could not leave my mouth.<br><br>
Resigned, I put on my robe and slippers. My co-diety murmured, half asleep, “Who is it?” “I don’t know, I have to go down I guess.”
I braced myself for the biting cold that awaited me with the mister on the other side of that door. I clenched the pores of my skin into tight goosebumps and gnashed my teeth, releasing calcium grits into my dry mouth. I reached for the door.<br><br></a></li></th>
